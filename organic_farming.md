## Organic Farming in India – A Comprehensive Snapshot (2024)

> **TL;DR** – India has evolved from a “home‑grown” organic movement into a global benchmark. In 2022–23 the domestic organic agriculture area exceeded 5.5 million ha, generating a market of ~$5.3 bn (USD). State‑led programmes, a rapidly expanding consumer base, and a nascent ecosystem of certification, finance and technology are driving the shift, but fragmented land‑ownership, certification costs, and limited processing infrastructure remain key bottlenecks.
